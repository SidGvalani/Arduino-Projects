Hello Prof. #fillName,
I am an undergraduate researcher at prof. Nain's lab, and a rising junior majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I have been spending the sumer characterizing conductive fibers by fabricating them using micro-spinning, testing them using beam
displacement, & measuring resistance using a 3 point probe method. I have been following your work since months such as Kiri Spoon, Safe Interaction via Monte-Carlo Linear Quadratic Games,
Robot Learning from 2D Drawings, etc.

I am extremely passionate about robotics and automating systems. I have developed a few projects such as a joystick controlled 4-DOF arm, web-server & NPN transistors controlled led, etc. My projects are visible in my Github repositories:

I have a YouTube channel where I break down Data Strucutres & Algorithms concepts such as Hash Maps, Linked Lists, Binary Search,etc and plan to upload mechanical design videos soon:
