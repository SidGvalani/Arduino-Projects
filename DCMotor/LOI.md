Dear Prof. Losey,
I am an undergraduate researcher at prof. Nain's lab, and a rising junior majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I have been spending the sumer characterizing conductive fibers by fabricating them using micro-spinning, testing them using beam
displacement, & measuring resistance using a 3 point probe method. I have been following your work since months such as Kiri Spoon, Safe Interaction via Monte-Carlo Linear Quadratic Games,
Robot Learning from 2D Drawings, etc.

I am extremely passionate about robotics and automating systems. I have developed a few projects such as a joystick controlled 4-DOF arm, web-server & NPN transistors controlled led, etc. My projects are visible in my Github repositories: 
````bash 
https://github.com/SiddhantGvalani 
```` They consist of Solidowrks models of robot arm desing, Python & C++ files, README files where I document my thought process & how to to problem solve.
I enjoy teachinf & improving my communication skills. I have a YouTube channel where I break down Data Strucutres & Algorithms concepts such as Hash Maps, Linked Lists, Binary Search,etc and plan to upload mechanical design videos soon:
````bash

If there is an opportuinity to be a part of your lab, perhaps through research or studies, please let me know as I would be honored and would be the perfect opportunity for me to explore my interests in robotics.
