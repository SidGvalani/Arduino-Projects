# Arduino-Projects 
Using Arduino IDE, GPIO and Microcontroller Interfacing to create projects for robotics applications.

## Description
In this repository, I write C++ commands to interface with Arduino Uno Rev3. 
With GPIO pins, I write 
digitalWrite()
digitalRead()
AnalogRead() (PWM enabled pins and Analog pins) 

They are used to interface with sensors such as 
Stepper, DC, and Servo Motors
Ultrasonic Sensors
Temperature & Humidity sensors, etc. 

These sensors either perform an output function or read an external signal.

## Installation 
1) Install the Arduino IDE (https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)
2) Clone this Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SidGvalani/Arduino-Projects.git
